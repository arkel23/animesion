# Overview
Anime character recognition (and tagging) using PyTorch.

Our best vision-only model, ViT L-16 with IFA classification head, image size 128x128 and batch size 16 
achieves 90.10% and 96.36% test set top-1 and top-5 classification accuracies, respectively, among 3263 characters! 
The best vision + tags model, ViLT L-16 reaches a top-1 accuracy of 90.30%!

We hope that this work inspires other researchers to follow and build upon this path.

# IFA Classification Head

We propose a simple change to the classification head that increases ViTs robustness against hyperparameters (mini-batch size), and increases performance for most settings, at relatively almost no additional computational cost, and which can be illustrated with the below figures:

# Tagging

# Features
* Variety of architectures to choose from: Shallow, Resnet18/50/152, EfficientNet-B0, Vi(L)T B-16/B-32/L-16/L-32
* Supports three datasets *moeImouto*, *DAF:re*, and [*iCartoonFace*](https://github.com/luxiangju-PersonAI/iCartoonFace). These contain 173, 3263 and 5013 classes, and 14K, 463K and 389K images, respectively.
* Pre-trained models for best performing models using image size of 128x128.
* Supporting scripts for making, visualization and stats for datasets.
* Scripts for training from scratch, evaluation (accuracy of a model with a certain set and pretrained weights), and inference (classifies (and optionally tags) all images in a given (`test_images` by default) folder.


# How to (summary)

## Data preparation
From `data` folder in Google Drive download `dafre_faces.tar.gz` for *DAF:re Faces* or `dafre_full.tar.gz` for *DAF:re Full*, and `labels.tar.gz` and uncompress their contents into desired data storage location (clone [DAF:re repo](https://github.com/arkel23/Danbooru2018AnimeCharacterRecognitionDataset_Revamped) and uncompress these folders). The `dataset_path` argument expects a path to the root that contains both `faces` or `fullMin256` directories, along with `labels` at the same level.

## Training
Train a ViT B-16 vision only model with intermediate features aggregation classification head on DanbooruFaces for recognition:

`python train.py --dataset_name danbooruFaces --dataset_path YOUR_PATH --model_name B_16 --image_size 128 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate_scheduler warmupCosine --pretrained --interm_features_fc`

Train a ViLT B-16 with tag/language tokens on DanbooruFull for recognition:

`python train.py --dataset_name danbooruFull --dataset_path YOUR_PATH --model_name B_16 --image_size 128 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate_scheduler warmupCosine --pretrained --multimodal --max_text_seq_len 32 --tokenizer wp`

Train a ViLT B-16 with tag/language tokens on DanbooruFull for recognition and tagging:

`python train.py --dataset_name danbooruFull --dataset_path YOUR_PATH --model_name B_16 --image_size 128 --batch_size 16 --learning_rate_scheduler warmupCosine --pretrained --multimodal --max_text_seq_len 16 --tokenizer tag --mask_schedule full --masking_behavior constant`

## Inference
Load pretrained model for recognition (defaults: B-16, IS=128):

`python inference.py --dataset_path YOUR_PATH --checkpoint_path PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT`

Load pretrained model for recognition and tagging (defaults: B-16, max_text_seq_len=16, tokenizer='tag'):

`python inference.py --dataset_path YOUR_PATH --checkpoint_path PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT --mode recognition_tagging`

Demo for recognition and tagging with [gradio](https://gradio.app/):

`python demo.py --dataset_path YOUR_PATH -checkpoint_path PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT`

## Evaluation
Evaluate on test set of chosen dataset using pretrained model for recognition (defaults: B-16, IS=128):

`python evaluate.py --dataset_path YOUR_PATH --checkpoint_path PATH_TO_CHECKPOINT`


# Sample results
![](./results_inference/homura_top.jpg)
![](./results_inference/kirito.jpg)
It not only works for anime images, but also works that take inspiration from anime, such as many videogames. 
![](./results_inference/dva.jpg)
And also for images that are not a face-crop:
![](./results_inference/rei_bodypillow.jpg)

We also tried it with people, and a cat:
![](./results_inference/muffin.jpg)

While the results were certainly far from perfect, this can serve as a basis for more studies on domain adaptation from natural images to sketches and drawn media.

# How to use (detailed)
The main scripts in this repo are the `train.py`, `evaluate.py` and `inference.py`.
 
## train.py
This script takes as input a set of hyperparameters (dataset to use, model, batch and image size, 
among others) and trains the model, either from scratch, or from a checkpoint. 
If training from a checkpoint, it can also use it to do knowledge transfer between datasets, 
by for example using a checkpoint trained on *DAF:re* to classify images according to the characters in *moeImouto*. 
It can also train a model based on both images and tags data.

## inference.py
Same arguments as previous one but also additionally takes mode (recognition_vision for recognition only, and recognition_tagging for doing both),
test_path for the images to test (tests all files in directory), results_infer (where to save), and save_results (save images with visualization of
class probabilities if doing vision ony recognition).

```
usage: inference.py [--mode {recognition_vision,recognition_tagging,generate_tags}] [--test_path TEST_PATH]
                    [--results_infer RESULTS_INFER] [--save_results SAVE_RESULTS]

                        The directory where test image is stored.
  --results_infer RESULTS_INFER

  --save_results SAVE_RESULTS
                        Save the images after transform and with label results.
```

## evaluate.py
Main functionality is the evaluate() function which loads a pretrained model from a checkpoint and evaluates it on the given dataset, 
returning top-1 and top-5 accuracies for the test split, along with accuracies and stats for each character class and stores it into log files with same name as checkpoint, 
and saved to `results_dir` which becomes `results_inference` by default but can be changed by using the argument.
Same arguments as `train.py` but includes eval_imagebyimage flag to inspect one by one wrong classification results 
(with possibility of saving them with save_results flag).
```
[--vis_arch] [--eval_imagebyimage] [--save_results]

  --vis_arch            Visualize architecture through model summary.
  --eval_imagebyimage   Evaluate all or image by image
  --save_results        Save the images after transform and with label results.
```


# Others

## Data exploration
Visualization for the data in terms of histograms, image grids, and statistics related to the classes distributions can be obtained by using `data_exploration.py`. Parent argument parser is the same as `train.py` but the important ones are the following:
```
[--split SPLIT]
                           [--data_vis_full] [--labels] [--display_images] [--stats_partial]

--split SPLIT         Split to visualize
  --data_vis_full       Save all images into a video.
  --labels              Include labels as title during the visualization video (requires a LOT more time).
  --display_images      If False skips to data_stats function else display images as single plot or video.
  --stats_partial       If true will display stats for a certain subset instead of the whole.
```
For example to generate a grid for danbooruFull's test split with labels printed as the title: 
`python data_exploration.py --dataset_path PATH --split test --display_image --dataset_name danbooruFull --labels`

For a visualization of all the splits (along with the labels): [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLenBV8wMp2FyJHvBZM4FBxua7JggUUqvQ). In total, there's 6 videos, 3 for *DAF:re Faces* and 3 for *moeImouto*.

A brief preview can be seen here for *DAF:re Faces* and *moeImouto*, respectively:

## Models
Shallow is a shallow, 5 layer (2 convolutional + 2 fully-connected) network. ResNet-18/152 has been the basis for many CNN architectures and was SotA for image classification just a few years ago [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). Vision Transformers [(ViT paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) are the new SotA for image classification in many standard benchmarks such as ImageNet, among others. Their significance is that they forego convolutions completely, and rely only on self-attention. This allows ViT to attend to distant regions in the image, as it looks as the whole image as a sequence of patches, all at once. This is in comparison to CNNs which traditionally "look" at the image patch by patch, rendering them unable to grasp long-range dependencies. [Vision Language Transformer (ViLT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03334) allows ViT to take text data as input by incorporating a text tokenizer similar to BERT, and therefore perform multimodal tasks.
